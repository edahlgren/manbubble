      <p>Hey dude.</p>

<p>You just landed in the tech mecca of California.  You&rsquo;ve hardly unpacked that plethora of cheap American Apparel t-shirts.  Get ready for a financially bloated bubble of endless fun, right?  Well, let&rsquo;s be honest, that&rsquo;s not all untrue: who <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> love being spoon fed from a giant financial bubble?  But you look around and one thing strikes you as odd: where are all the chicks?</p>

<p>Hate to break it to you, man, but there&rsquo;s relatively few of us here.  We creep around silently, passing in an out of coffee shops like ghosts in the night, disguised as androgyne in men&rsquo;s sized swag.  Great news: most of us don&rsquo;t have three heads.  Some of us are even pretty cute.  Smart?  Well, buckle up.</p>

<p>So how do you meet one of us?  Let&rsquo;s start at your new job.  Maybe there&rsquo;s a plethora of us who hired you, manage your 401k and keep track of your health insurance.  If you think wooing someone who has control of your income is a great idea, then I have no hope for you: go ahead and see what happens.  Maybe there&rsquo;s a few of us who are working in sales and support.  This could be promising for you, but I suspect (I do not know) that after 3 dates, especially if you&rsquo;re an engineer, you&rsquo;ll scare her away with your brutally scientific worldview.</p>

<p>If on the off chance you&rsquo;ve joined one of those companies that hired that rare breed of female programmer, realize that this woman probably doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about you.  There&rsquo;s a lot of copies of your stereotype everywhere she looks.  What do you do?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Black box approach:</p>

<p> Smile and see what happens.  Does she cringe?  Evaluate in the mirror whether your smile looks like that of a serial killer.  If so, iterate; otherwise, leave her alone.  The important part of this approach is the back off, which should be exponential.</p></li>
<li><p>Depth first search approach:</p>

<p> Start asking her 20 questions.  Don&rsquo;t start with &ldquo;Are you an animal, mineral, or vegetable?&rdquo;  Maybe, &ldquo;What do you like making for fun?&rdquo;  This is appropriately general, with enough of a tree to walk in any direction of the answer.  If said in a friendly way, you might not appear like a total creep.  &ldquo;Espresso or drip?&rdquo;  Unless you have sufficient evidence that she&rsquo;ll care about the relative evils of the long stem pour over technique, you&rsquo;ll be doomed to utter stalemate.</p></li>
<li><p>Breadth first search approach:</p>

<p> Ask her if she knows anyone else who&rsquo;s really cool in the area.  More than likely, her tree will be sprinkled more densely with other chicks than that guy&rsquo;s sitting next to you.  Iterate when you find another chick, and so on.  Sometimes admitting that it&rsquo;s hard to meet women and you need her help will go far in your favor, so long as you don&rsquo;t act like a dog with rabies ready to bite.</p></li>
<li><p>Random walk approach:</p>

<p> Go outside.  Try not to look like a total predator, pause for a fixed period of time, and count how many women pass you.  Then go right or left randomly.  Repeat.  Plot your data on a map.  Repeat the experiment for several sessions.  Warning: this approach is inefficient and prone to failure.  Likelihood of eventually talking with a woman is low.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Last rule: don&rsquo;t tell her any of this.  Unless on the of chance she finds it fascinating to be thought of as a &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, which is 1% likely at best, for sure she&rsquo;ll want to strangle you.  Save your success story for when you both have wrinkles and she doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to divorce you.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
