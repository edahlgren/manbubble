    <div class="post-title">Five effective ways to throw in the towel</div>
    <div class="post-date">Sunday, February  2 &#39;14</div>

    <div class="post-wrapper">
      <p>In order of time efficiency:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fall in love with them and get romantically flattened at least 6 times.  By the 6th time you&rsquo;ll be so emotionally burnt out that they&rsquo;ll look more like a noodle than a human.  Be warned: there is no guarantee that they will stay a noodle.  This option is good for those who want to preserve a friendship and thereby commit total emotional suicide.</p></li>
<li><p>If on the off chance you aren&rsquo;t also a noodle (non-noodles make up approximately 5% of the world&rsquo;s population), gtfo.  For the rest of us noodles, this is very hard, so keep reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on how shitty you are at something, and try to get better at it.  You might actually feel something like &hellip; oh I don&rsquo;t know &hellip; self worth?  Be warned: once you stop focusing on your shittiness, you&rsquo;ll feel just as emotionally hopeless as you originally did.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a voodoo doll of them.  And then get reported to the police.</p></li>
<li><p>Throw a towel at them.  To avoid this being interpreted as a joke, cackle loudly, throw back your head and lift your hands to the sky.  Your newfound insanity will solve all of the remaining problems.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>At all times during this process avoid:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Substance abuse.  This was going to be the 3rd recommended way to throw in the towel, until I realized that it promotes noodlehood.</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to sad music from Iran.</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to the same song over and over &mdash; gasp, even if it&rsquo;s by Cher &mdash; because you&rsquo;ll eventually make it sound very depressing.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a noodle.</p></li>
</ol>
