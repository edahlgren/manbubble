	  <p>You might have grey hair.  Maybe you have exactly one grey hair.  Maybe your head looks like it got stuck in a giant salt and pepper shaker.  Just salt?</p>

<p>Whatever transpires on top of your head or under your nose, if it&rsquo;s grey or white, answer this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you a member of the almighty religion, the <em>Church of Boring</em>?</p></blockquote>

<p>The trinity of the <em>Church of Boring</em> includes the half-zip sweater, the slip-on leather shoe, and the oversized grey wool coat.  Commandments include &ldquo;thou must act thou age&rdquo;. Members of this religion must be baptized with Whole Foods bags in which they carry all of their belongings to the gym.  Sacraments include the act of exuding Boring.  There is no requirement on how often the sacraments are practiced, but most practice daily.</p>

<p>If so, I humbly recommend a forced conversion to a little known religion called <em>Gandalfism</em>.</p>

<p>Never heard of <em>Gandalfism</em>?  Not a surprise, it is very unknown outside of New Zealand.  <em>Gandalfism</em>, my friend, is the belief that grey hair leads to eternal bliss, here and in the afterlife.  Meditative practices include not acting one&rsquo;s age.  For instance, slaying a giant dragon-like thing made of fire.</p>

<p>There is also strict observance of the holy holiday: Day to Mesmerize Chicks With My Awesome Grey Hair.  It occurs every day.  Half-zips are sacrilegious in <em>Gandalfism</em>.</p>

<p>Members of <em>Gandalfism</em> can be seen in public riding their motorcycle or bicycle or tricycle while letting their grey hair billow behind them.  They are also known to compliment women on their amazing white-grey locks, which we all know, is an essential public service.</p>

<p>There are three important factions of <em>Gandalfism</em>: <strong>Conservative Gandalfism</strong>, where it is believed that the religious scripture comes from the divine mouth of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Conservative Gandalfism requires that  &ldquo;a white beard hung down below his waist&rdquo; is followed is by all members.</p>

<p>There is <strong>Liberal Gandalfism</strong>, where the scripture comes from the less divine mouth of Peter Jackson.  Finally there is <strong>Who-Gives-A-Fuck Gandalfism</strong>, where the scripture is nonexistent and belief is reinforced by pictures on the internet.  I recommend the latter &hellip; there are no recorded acts of hate crimes against this faction.</p>

<p>Whichever faction of <em>Gandalfism</em> suits you, remember that it&rsquo;s not about Gandalf.  It&rsquo;s about you, your one grey hair, and your pipe &hellip; which I&rsquo;m sure has nothing to do with your forced religious conversion.</p>

	  <p>Hey dude.</p>

<p>You just landed in the tech mecca of California.  You&rsquo;ve hardly unpacked that plethora of cheap American Apparel t-shirts.  Get ready for a financially bloated bubble of endless fun, right?  Well, let&rsquo;s be honest, that&rsquo;s not all untrue: who <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> love being spoon fed from a giant financial bubble?  But you look around and one thing strikes you as odd: where are all the chicks?</p>

<p>Hate to break it to you, man, but there&rsquo;s relatively few of us here.  We creep around silently, passing in an out of coffee shops like ghosts in the night, disguised as androgyne in men&rsquo;s sized swag.  Great news: most of us don&rsquo;t have three heads.  Some of us are even pretty cute.  Smart?  Well, buckle up.</p>

<p>So how do you meet one of us?  Let&rsquo;s start at your new job.  Maybe there&rsquo;s a plethora of us who hired you, manage your 401k and keep track of your health insurance.  If you think wooing someone who has control of your income is a great idea, then I have no hope for you: go ahead and see what happens.  Maybe there&rsquo;s a few of us who are working in sales and support.  This could be promising for you, but I suspect (I do not know) that after 3 dates, especially if you&rsquo;re an engineer, you&rsquo;ll scare her away with your brutally scientific worldview.</p>

<p>If on the off chance you&rsquo;ve joined one of those companies that hired that rare breed of female programmer, realize that this woman probably doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about you.  There&rsquo;s a lot of copies of your stereotype everywhere she looks.  What do you do?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Black box approach:</p>

<p> Smile and see what happens.  Does she cringe?  Evaluate in the mirror whether your smile looks like that of a serial killer.  If so, iterate; otherwise, leave her alone.  The important part of this approach is the back off, which should be exponential.</p></li>
<li><p>Depth first search approach:</p>

<p> Start asking her 20 questions.  Don&rsquo;t start with &ldquo;Are you an animal, mineral, or vegetable?&rdquo;  Maybe, &ldquo;What do you like making for fun?&rdquo;  This is appropriately general, with enough of a tree to walk in any direction of the answer.  If said in a friendly way, you might not appear like a total creep.  &ldquo;Espresso or drip?&rdquo;  Unless you have sufficient evidence that she&rsquo;ll care about the relative evils of the long stem pour over technique, you&rsquo;ll be doomed to utter stalemate.</p></li>
<li><p>Breadth first search approach:</p>

<p> Ask her if she knows anyone else who&rsquo;s really cool in the area.  More than likely, her tree will be sprinkled more densely with other chicks than that guy&rsquo;s sitting next to you.  Iterate when you find another chick, and so on.  Sometimes admitting that it&rsquo;s hard to meet women and you need her help will go far in your favor, so long as you don&rsquo;t act like a dog with rabies ready to bite.</p></li>
<li><p>Random walk approach:</p>

<p> Go outside.  Try not to look like a total predator, pause for a fixed period of time, and count how many women pass you.  Then go right or left randomly.  Repeat.  Plot your data on a map.  Repeat the experiment for several sessions.  Warning: this approach is inefficient and prone to failure.  Likelihood of eventually talking with a woman is low.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Last rule: don&rsquo;t tell her any of this.  Unless on the of chance she finds it fascinating to be thought of as a &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, which is 1% likely at best, for sure she&rsquo;ll want to strangle you.  Save your success story for when you both have wrinkles and she doesn&rsquo;t have the heart to divorce you.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
