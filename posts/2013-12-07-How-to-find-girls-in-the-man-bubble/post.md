title: How to find girls in the man bubble
author: E. Dahlgren

Hey dude.

You just landed in the tech mecca of California with a plethora of corny American Apparel t-shirts (you knew you were supposed to dress down, so you could join the Church of Casual).  Get ready for a financially bloated bubble of endless fun, right?  Congratualtions!  Well, let's be honest, that's not all untrue: who *doesn't* love being spoon fed from a giant financial bubble?  But you look around and one thing strikes you as odd: where are all the chicks?

Hate to break it to you, man, but there's relatively few of us here.  We creep around silently, passing in an out of coffee shops like ghosts in the night, disguised as androgyne in men's sized swag.  Great news: most of us don't have three heads.  Some of us are even pretty cute.  Smart?  Well, buckle up.

So how do you meet one of us?  Let's start at your new job.  Maybe there's a plethora of us who hired you, manage your 401k and keep track of your health insurance.  If you think wooing someone who has control of your income is a great idea, then I have no hope for you: go ahead and see what happens.  Maybe there's a few of us who are working in sales and support.  This could be promising for you, but I suspect (I do not know) that after 3 dates, especially if you're an engineer, you'll scare her away with your brutally scientific worldview.

If on the off chance you've joined one of those companies that hired that rare breed of female programmer, realize that this woman probably doesn't give a shit about you.  There's a lot of copies of your stereotype everywhere she looks.  What do you do?


0. Black box approach:

    Smile and see what happens.  Does she cringe?  Evaluate in the mirror whether your smile looks like that of a serial killer.  If so, iterate; otherwise, leave her alone.  The important part of this approach is the back off, which should be exponential.


1. Depth first search approach:

    Start asking her 20 questions.  Don't start with "Are you an animal, mineral, or vegetable?"  Maybe, "What do you like making for fun?"  This is appropriately general, with enough of a tree to walk in any direction of the answer.  If said in a friendly way, you might not appear like a total creep.  "Espresso or drip?"  Unless you have sufficient evidence that she'll care about the relative evils of the long stem pour over technique, you'll be doomed to utter stalemate.


2. Breadth first search approach:

    Ask her if she knows anyone else who's really cool in the area.  More than likely, her tree will be sprinkled more densely with other chicks than that guy's sitting next to you.  Iterate when you find another chick, and so on.  Sometimes admitting that it's hard to meet women and you need her help will go far in your favor, so long as you don't act like a dog with rabies ready to bite.

3. Random walk approach:

    Go outside.  Try not to look like a total predator, pause for a fixed period of time, and count how many women pass you.  Then go right or left randomly.  Repeat.  Plot your data on a map.  Repeat the experiment for several sessions.  Warning: this approach is inefficient and prone to failure.  Likelihood of eventually talking with a woman is low.

Last rule: don't tell her any of this.  Unless on the of chance she finds it fascinating to be thought of as a "problem", which is 1% likely at best, for sure she'll want to strangle you.  Save your success story for when you both have wrinkles and she doesn't have the heart to divorce you.

Good luck!
