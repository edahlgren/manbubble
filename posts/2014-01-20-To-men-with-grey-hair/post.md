title: To men with grey hair
author: Erin Dahlgren

You might have grey hair.  Maybe you have exactly one grey hair.  Maybe your head looks like it got stuck in a giant salt and pepper shaker.  Just salt?

Whatever transpires on top of your head or under your nose, if it's grey or white, answer this:  

>Are you a member of the almighty religion, the *Church of Boring*?  

The trinity of the *Church of Boring* includes the half-zip sweater, the slip-on leather shoe, and the oversized grey wool coat.  Commandments include "thou must act thou age". Members of this religion must be baptized with Whole Foods bags in which they carry all of their belongings to the gym.  Sacraments include the act of exuding Boring.  There is no requirement on how often the sacraments are practiced, but most practice daily.

If so, I humbly recommend a forced conversion to a little known religion called *Gandalfism*.

Never heard of *Gandalfism*?  Not a surprise, it is very unknown outside of New Zealand.  *Gandalfism*, my friend, is the belief that grey hair leads to eternal bliss, here and in the afterlife.  Meditative practices include not acting one's age.  For instance, slaying a giant dragon-like thing made of fire.

There is also strict observance of the holy holiday: Day to Mesmerize Chicks With My Awesome Grey Hair.  It occurs every day.  Half-zips are sacrilegious in *Gandalfism*.

Members of *Gandalfism* can be seen in public riding their motorcycle or bicycle or tricycle while letting their grey hair billow behind them.  They are also known to compliment women on their amazing white-grey locks, which we all know, is an essential public service.

There are three important factions of *Gandalfism*: **Conservative Gandalfism**, where it is believed that the religious scripture comes from the divine mouth of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Conservative Gandalfism requires that  "a white beard hung down below his waist" is followed is by all members.

There is **Liberal Gandalfism**, where the scripture comes from the less divine mouth of Peter Jackson.  Finally there is **Who-Gives-A-Fuck Gandalfism**, where the scripture is nonexistent and belief is reinforced by pictures on the internet.  I recommend the latter ... there are no recorded acts of hate crimes against this faction.

Whichever faction of *Gandalfism* suits you, remember that it's not about Gandalf.  It's about you, your one grey hair, and your pipe ... which I'm sure has nothing to do with your forced religious conversion.
