title: Five effective ways to throw in the towel
author: E. Dahlgren

In order of time efficiency:

1. Fall in love with them and get romantically flattened at least 6 times.  By the 6th time you'll be so emotionally burnt out that they'll look more like a noodle than a human.  Be warned: there is no guarantee that they will stay a noodle.  This option is good for those who want to preserve a friendship and thereby commit total emotional suicide.

2. If on the off chance you aren't also a noodle (non-noodles make up approximately 5% of the world's population), gtfo.  For the rest of us noodles, this is very hard, so keep reading.

3. Focus on how shitty you are at something, and try to get better at it.  You might actually feel something like ... oh I don't know ... self worth?  Be warned: once you stop focusing on your shittiness, you'll feel just as emotionally hopeless as you originally did.

4. Make a voodoo doll of them.  And then get reported to the police.

5.  Throw a towel at them.  To avoid this being interpreted as a joke, cackle loudly, throw back your head and lift your hands to the sky.  Your newfound insanity will solve all of the remaining problems.


At all times during this process avoid:

1. Substance abuse.  This was going to be the 3rd recommended way to throw in the towel, until I realized that it promotes noodlehood.

2. Listening to sad music from Iran.

3. Listening to the same song over and over --- gasp, even if it's by Cher --- because you'll eventually make it sound very depressing.

4. Being a noodle.
